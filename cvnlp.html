This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory. <br>Sub-domains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, event detection, video tracking, object recognition, 3D pose estimation, learning, indexing, motion estimation, and image restoration.<br></p>

Recognition - </strong>The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity. Different varieties of the recognition problem are described in the literature.</div><div><strong>a.	Object recognition (also called object classification) – </strong>one or several pre-specified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized.</div><div><strong>b.	Identification – </strong>an individual instance of an object is recognized. Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or identification of a specific vehicle.</div><div><strong>c.	Detection – </strong>the image data are scanned for a specific condition. Examples include detection of possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2. &nbsp;Motion analysis - </strong>Several tasks relate to motion estimation where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the 3D scene, or even of the camera that produces the images.</div><div><strong>Examples of such tasks are:</strong></div><div><strong>a.	Egomotion – </strong>determining the 3D rigid motion (rotation and translation) of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.</div><div><strong>b.	Tracking – </strong>following the movements of a (usually) smaller set of interest points or objects (e.g., vehicles, humans or other organisms) in the image sequence.</div><div><strong>c.	Optical flow –</strong> to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion.&nbsp;</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>3.	Scene reconstruction - </strong>Given one or (typically) more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a 3D model of the scene. In the simplest case the model can be a set of 3D points. More sophisticated methods produce a complete 3D surface model.&nbsp;</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>4.	Image restoration -&nbsp;</strong>The aim of image restoration is the removal of noise (sensor noise, motion blur, etc.) from images. The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters such as low-pass filters or median filters. More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look like, a model which distinguishes them from the noise. The example below shows de-blurring an image using image restoration.</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><p></p></div>

This involves allowing users to query data sets in the form of a question that they might pose to another person. The machine interprets the important elements of the human language sentence, such as those that might correspond to specific features in a data set, and returns an answer.</div><div><br></div><div>NLP can be used to interpret free text and make it analyzable. There is a tremendous amount of information stored in free text files, like patients' medical records, for example. Prior to deep learning-based NLP models, this information was inaccessible to computer-assisted analysis and could not be analyzed in any kind of systematic way. But NLP allows analysts to sift through massive troves of free text to find relevant information in the files.</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>Sentiment analysis is another primary use case for NLP. Using sentiment analysis, data scientists can assess comments on social media to see how their business's brand is performing, for example, or review notes from customer service teams to identify areas where people want the business to perform better.</div><div><br></div><div>Google and other search engines base their machine translation technology on NLP deep learning models. This allows algorithms to read text on a webpage, interpret its meaning and translate it to another language.</div><div><strong><br></strong></div></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Applications of NLP -&nbsp;</strong><div><br></div><div><strong>1.	Machine Translation</strong> - The challenge with machine translation technologies is not in translating words, but in preserving the meaning of sentences, a complex technological issue that is at the heart of NLP.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2.	Fighting Spam </strong>- Spam filters have become important as the first line of defense against the ever-increasing problem of unwanted email. But almost everyone that uses email extensively has experienced agony over unwanted emails that are still received, or important emails that have been accidentally caught in the filter. The false-positive and false-negative issues of spam filters are at the heart of NLP technology, again boiling down to the challenge of extracting meaning from strings of text. A technology that has received much attention is Bayesian spam filtering, a statistical technique in which the incidence of words in an email is measured against its typical occurrence in a corpus of spam and non-spam emails.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>3.	Information Extraction </strong>- Many important decisions in financial markets are increasingly moving away from human oversight and control. Algorithmic trading is becoming more popular, a form of financial investing that is entirely controlled by technology. But many of these financial decisions are impacted by news, by journalism which is still presented predominantly in English. A major task, then, of NLP has become taking these plaintext announcements, and extracting the pertinent info in a format that can be factored into algorithmic trading decisions. For example, news of a merger between companies can have a big impact on trading decisions, and the speed at which the particulars of the merger, players, prices, who acquires who​ can be incorporated into a trading algorithm can have profit implications in the millions of dollars.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>4.	Summarization</strong> - Information overload is a real phenomenon in our digital age, and already our access to knowledge and information far exceeds our capacity to understand it. This is a trend that shows no sign of slowing down, and so an ability to summarize the meaning of documents and information is becoming increasingly important. This is important not just in allowing us the ability to recognize and absorb the pertinent information from vast amounts of data. Another desired outcome is to understand deeper emotional meanings, for example, based on aggregated data from social media, can a company determine the general sentiment for its latest product offering? This branch of NLP will become increasingly useful as a valuable marketing asset.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>5.	Question Answering</strong> - Search engines put the world's wealth of information at our fingertips, but are still generally quite primitive when it comes to actually answering specific questions posed by humans. Google has seen the frustration this has caused in users, who often need to try a number of different search results to find the answer they are looking for. A big focus of Google's efforts in NLP has been to recognize natural language questions, extract the meaning, and provide the answer, and the evolution of Google's results page has shown this focus. Though certainly improving, this remains a major challenge for search engines, and one of the main applications of natural language processing research.</div><div><br></div></div>
